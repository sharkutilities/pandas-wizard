styling guide. For full details, see the [commit logs](https://github.com/sharkutilities/pandas-wizard/commits).

## `PEP0440` Styling Guide

<details>
<summary>Click to open <code>PEP0440</code> Styilng Guide</summary>

Packaging for `PyPI` follows the standard PEP0440 styling guide and is implemented by the **`packaging.version.Version`** class. The other
popular versioning scheme is [`semver`](https://semver.org/), but each build has different parts/mapping.
The following table gives a mapping between these two versioning schemes:

<div align = "center">

| `PyPI` Version | `semver` Version |
| :---: | :---: |
| `epoch` | n/a |
| `major` | `major` |
| `minor` | `minor` |
| `micro` | `patch` |
| `pre` | `prerelease` |
| `dev` | `build` |
| `post` | n/a |

</div>

One can use the **`packaging`** version to convert between PyPI to semver and vice-versa. For more information, check

## Release Note(s)

The release notes are documented, the list of changes to each different release are documented. The `major.minor` patch are indicated
under `h3` tags, while the `micro` and "version identifiers" are listed under `h4` and subsequent headlines. The legend for
changelogs are as follows:

  * üéâ - **Major Feature** : something big that was not available before.
  * ‚ú® - **Feature Enhancement** : a miscellaneous minor improvement of an existing feature.
  * üõ†Ô∏è - **Patch/Fix** : something that previously didn‚Äôt work as documented ‚Äì or according to reasonable expectations ‚Äì should now work.
  * ‚öôÔ∏è - **Code Efficiency** : an existing feature now may not require as much computation or memory.
  * üí£ - **Code Refactoring** : a breakable change often associated with `major` version bump.

### Version 1.0.0

We're pleased to annouce the first major release and preview-built for **`pandaswizard`**! This version mainly focuses on enduser
feedback and basic setup for the module.

#### Version 1.0.0.dev0 | Release Date: 19.04.2024

The first `dev` or `preview-build` for `v1.0.0` focusing on function development and objective documentation. The version
focuses on providing basic features like:

  * üéâ `pandaswizard.quantile`: A simple function to calculate quantile of a grouped data series,
  * üéâ `pandaswizard.percentile`: A simple function to calculate percentile of a grouped data series.
