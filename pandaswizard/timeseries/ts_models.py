A Set of Simplistic Time Series Models

    A Set of Moving Average (MA) based Models for Time Series Methods
    
    A moving average is the most simple timeseries model, which is
    implemented using python. However, when used well the MA model is
    able to provide much analysis and is one of the favorites for a
    quick understanding in the stock market.
    
    Note, the `.rolling` and `.cumsum` methods of `pandas` and
    `numpy` respectively is used internally where required to
    achieve the forecast.

    The model is an extension for moving average, and can be used to
    forecast into the future on a rolling basis. Example:

    ```python
    N_LOOKBACK = 4
    N_FORECAST = 5

    # given the series, the rolling forecast for `N_FORECAST` period:
    simple_ma = MovingAverage(
        n_lookback = N_LOOKBACK,
        n_forecast = N_FORECAST,
        series = np.array([12, 7, 27, 34])
    ).simple()

    >> np.array([20.00, 22.00, 25.75, 25.25, 23.00])
    ```

    :type  n_lookback: int
    :param n_lookback: Number of periods to lookback into the past.
                       Typically, 'n-lags' is a good indicator of
                       price, as the price of `(N+1)` is always a
                       factor of `N, N-1, N-2, ..., N-n` where `n`
                       can be determined statistically.

    :type  n_forecast: int
    :param n_forecast: Number of periods to forecast into the future.

    :param series: Time series data, where each item of the iterable
                   is a value at interval `n, ..., N-2, N-1, N` where

        Exponential Moving Average Forecasting

        An exponential moving average is an extension of the
        moving average algorithm that places an greater weightage to
        the recent data points. The EMA is also referred to as the
        exponentially weighted moving average.

        Side note: In financial market, like all moving average
        metrices, the EMA is a technical indicator which is used to
        produce buy and sell signals based on crossovers and
        divergence on crossovers.
        (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp)

        In addition, traders often use different EMA lengths of
        10-, 50-, and 200-days moving average as an indicator.

        However, in time series forecasting (like price forecasting)
        the order (`q`) can be determined from the ACF & PACF tests.
        But, in case of exponential smoothening/forecasting the order
        is referred as `alpha` which is the coefficient of level
        smoothening.

        EMA(T+1) = sum(
            alpha * EMA(T)
            + (alpha / 2) * EMA(T-1)
            + (alpha / 4) * EMA(T-2)
            + ...
            + (alpha / 2^n) * EMA(T-n)
        )

        :param alpha: The coefficient for level smoothening.
