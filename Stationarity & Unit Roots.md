Stationarity is one of the fundamental concepts in time series analysis. The **time series data model works on the principle that the [_data is stationary_](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/how-to-check-stationarity-of-data-in-python/)**, this means:
  * the data must have a constant mean (across all periods),
  * the data should have a constant variance, and
  * auto-covariance should not be dependent on time.

Let's understand the concept using the following example, for more information check [this link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/09/non-stationary-time-series-python/).
