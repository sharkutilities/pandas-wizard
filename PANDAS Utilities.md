## Getting Started

The code is publically available at [**GitHub gists**](https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown) which is a simple platform for sharing *code snippets* with the community. To use the code, simply clone the code like:

```shell
git clone https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown/.git pandas_
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:pandas_"
```

Done, you can now easily import the function with *python* notebooks/code-files like:

```python
import pandas_ as pd_ # kept same convention
```
